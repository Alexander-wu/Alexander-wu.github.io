<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>


I am Hao Wu, currently a second-year master's student in the Department of Computer Science at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/). I am also a joint training student in the large model training group of the Machine Learning Platform Department at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/). My research interests are as follows:


* **AI/ML for Science**: Under the guidance of [Xiao Luo](https://luoxiao12.github.io/), I study machine learning and fluid dynamics.

* **Spatio-temporal Prediction**: With the guidance of [Kun Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UnyqjWQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Yuxuan Liang](https://yuxuanliang.com/), I explore foundational models for spatiotemporal data mining. Additionally, I am honored to collaborate with [Xingjian Shi](https://sxjscience.github.io/) and [Weiyan Wang](https://weiyan-wang.github.io/), whose ConvLSTM introduced me to this field.

* **AI for Earth**: I am privileged to be part of Xiaomeng Huang's AI4Earth Lab [Xiaomeng Huang](http://faculty.dess.tsinghua.edu.cn/huangxiaomeng/en/index.htm), where I learn a lot about geophysics.

* **Large Models (Text-to-Video)**: I am diligently studying this field.

In addition, I have a strong interest in machine learning frameworks and scientific large models, currently researching this area with Shuaipeng Li and others.
